4. **Click Deploy**

**OR use the zip file method:**

Then upload `stockpredictor-build.zip` to Vercel dashboard.

## ✅ Option 2: GitHub Integration (Best for long-term)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

2. Repository name: `stock-predictor-saas`
3. Make it Public
4. Don't add README
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push Code to GitHub
```bash
# In your terminal (run from this directory):
cd "/Users/peterolson/Downloads/diamondiq/deploy/downloads/diamondiq/stock-predictor-saas"

# Add your GitHub repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stock-predictor-saas.git

# Push the code
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Connect Vercel
1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Import from GitHub
3. Select your `stock-predictor-saas` repository
4. Framework: **Vite**
5. Build Command: `npm run build`
6. Output Directory: `dist`

## ✅ Option 3: Try Vercel CLI Again

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd "/Users/peterolson/Downloads/diamondiq/deploy/downloads/diamondiq/stock-predictor-saas"

# Try installing Vercel CLI locally
npx vercel --version

# If that works, deploy:
npx vercel login
npx vercel --prod
```

## 🔧 Environment Variables (For Any Method)

After deployment, add these in Vercel dashboard:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-railway-backend.railway.app
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_stripe_key
```

## 📁 Your Project Files Are Here:
**Directory**: `/Users/peterolson/Downloads/diamondiq/deploy/downloads/diamondiq/stock-predictor-saas`

**Built Files**: `dist/` folder (ready to upload)

## 🎯 What's Ready:
- ✅ Complete React app built
- ✅ All 11 features implemented
- ✅ Production-optimized bundle
- ✅ Railway backend-ready API calls
- ✅ Stripe integration configured

## 🚀 Quick Test After Deployment:

1. **Landing page** should load with dark theme
2. **Register** should work (creates account)
3. **Login** should authenticate
4. **Dashboard** should show user interface

## 💡 Pro Tip:
